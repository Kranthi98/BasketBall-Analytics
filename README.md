# BasketBall-Analytics

With Fantasy sports growing bigger and bigger with each day. With loads of data available on the internet. I have tried to create a model for projecting a player's fantasy value against a certain lineup.

Data has been collected from Eurobasket.com

Inspired by the film MoneyBall and the way analytics have revolutionised the sports.I wanted to expose myself to the field,
in the pursuit of that i have choosen Basketball since i felt that this sport had minimum number of factors affecting the outcomes.
Well this statement is subjective but with the choices i had that's how i felt.Keeping in mind the availability of data and number of players in a team.

In this project i have calculated the metrics both for offensive and as well as defensive. I referred Dean Oliver's BasketBall on Paper for the formulae.
I have made a change in the player efficiency calculation as per the fantasy points awarded for each category.

The ultimate aim is to model the performances of players for a particular matchup. Well i cant say i have been succeeded in doing that. 
But will be aiming to complete the project by the end of 2022. Thanks for visiting.
