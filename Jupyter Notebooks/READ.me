Inspired by the film MoneyBall and the way analytics have revolutionised the sports.I wanted to expose myself to the field, in the pursuit of that i have choosen Basketball since
i felt that this sport had minimum number of factors affecting the outcomes. Well this statement is subjective but of the choices i had i felt it.Keeping in mind the availability of data and number of players in a team.

In this project i have calculated the metrics both for offensive and as well as defensive. I referred Dean Oliver's BasketBall on Paper for the formulae.
I have made a change in the player efficiency calculation as per the fantasy points awarded for each category.

The ultimate aim is to model the performances of players for a particular matchup. Well i cant say i have been succeeded in doing that. But will be aiming to complete the project by the end of 2022. Thanks for visiting.
